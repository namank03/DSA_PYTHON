Static/Dynamic array - Dynamic array can grow in size as an when required while the static array size is fixed.

Dynamic array can be created from the static array. We need to keep the track of the array size and when the no more element can be added we need to create a new array with 2 times the capacity of the initial one and copy the element to this new array
