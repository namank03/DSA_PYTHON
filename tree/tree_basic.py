# We can check if it's a tree when there are n nodes and n-1 edges. Ex - file directory / HTML Doc.
# We can store tree's via edge list or adjacency list (more popular as it gives easy access to neighbors).
# * Rooted tree -> directed edges moving away from root node. Binary tree is a tree with 2 child nodes. Binary search tree left child value must be less than root node value and right child value must be greater than root node value.
# we can access a node parent via recursive callback.
