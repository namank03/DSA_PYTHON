There are 2 types of graphs:

1. Undirected Graph
2. Directed Graph

The graphs are mostly represented via adjacency list. In python it can be represented as a dict with keys as a node and it's neighbor as a list of values.

2 Types of traversal:

1. Depth First (Uses Stack)
2. Breadth First (Uses Queue)

TIP -> Base is the case in recursion when there's no recursive call and we can use this logic to implement the depth 1st search via recursion
